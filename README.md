# the-temporary-plane

A RESTful game I'm working on.

### Getting started

To get going into the world you will need to register your character name, set a race, set a class, and finally your starting city.

1. `/api/register/<player name>`
2. [Race](/src/handlers/races/)
3. [Class](/src/handlers/classes/)
4. [Cities](/src/handlers/cities/)
